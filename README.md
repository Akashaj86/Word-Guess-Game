# Word-Guess-Game
Single player Hangman game (wk 3 homework)
This is a project created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The idea is to create a hangman word guess game with a Marvel's Avengers theme.
The user is expected to enter letters that fills in the blanks with the desired word. If the user correctly fills out the blanks without using up too many
chances/Lives, the user will win and see a victory message via alert box. If the user has used up too many Lives before filling out the blanks with the correct word,
the user will lose the game and see an unpleasant message via alert box.
